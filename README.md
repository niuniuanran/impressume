This will be a web application that makes nice resume for the user.
There will be two main functions:
<dl>
<dt><strong>Static Resume</strong></dt>
<dd>making static resume html page that user can easily print as a pdf file.</dd>
<dt>Responsive Resume</dt>
<dd>making responsive resume html page, that work nicely on recruiters' desktops and phones. This requests users to register and 
put their info on the server database so I can host the page for them.</dd>
</dl>

The journal directory contains current updates on building this project, and problems to be shot. 
You are most welcome and appreciated for any suggestions and contributions!
