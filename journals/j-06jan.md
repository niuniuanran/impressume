Today I will be trying to achieve the make-cv function.

The server will save in the session: 
* The ResumeStar object that will be updated with each form submitted.

The form will submit with it:
* star's information

How do I track where the user is at current stage?
I will use the same servlet each time the user submits the form.
The servlet will redirect to the same form each time it finishes processing
updated information.

So if I save the current stage in the request
by letting the user select where she is - option?
