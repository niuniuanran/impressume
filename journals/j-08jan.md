DONE
<ul>
<li>Improved the algorithm to calculate lighter color. Now it is a nice light color with a hint of grey mixed in.
</li>
<li>
Now I can upload an image to the images folder and show it at the right position.
</li>
</ul>

TO DO
<ul>
<li>
Resizing the image is so hard. Maybe I'll ask the user to chop their own image for now.
</li>
<li>
Put the prompt at the right position, and make it disappear/ move on to the next prompt after finished.
</li>

</ul>

POSSIBLE IDEA:
<li>
Can I make a guidance-div, semi-transparent, at a fixed position on the page,
that interacts with the user as a whole? The user will see what is going on at the page from behind the semi-transparent div.
</li>
